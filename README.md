The solar radio telescope is located outside the visitor center at the Very Large Array site for educational purpose for visitors. The entire system of this telescope was re-designed, detecting RF energy and displaying DC voltage on Voltmeter. Construction and installation of the electrical system were done in August 2023 by other members of the supporting team, who confirmed that the system was sufficiently functional. However, more improvement on the dynamic range on the voltmeter and additional indications were needed to attract a wider range of visitors in regards to age and background knowledge.
